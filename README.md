# SQL Challenge
The task is a research project about people whom a company employed during the 80s and 90s. All that remains of the employee database from that period are 6 CSV files. I’ll design tables to hold the data from the CSV files, import the files into a SQL database, and answer questions about the data. This is to practice data modeling, data engineering, and data analysis.
